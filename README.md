# Banker's Algorithm Project

## Project Overview
This project implements the Banker's Algorithm in C++. It's designed to determine if a system of processes and resources is in a safe state, avoiding deadlocks, and to find a safe sequence for process execution.

## How to Compile and Run
1. **Compile the Program:**
2.  **Run the Program:**

3.  ## Input File Format
The `input.txt` file should be formatted as follows:
- First line: Number of processes.
- Second line: Number of resources.
- Next lines: Allocation matrix, one row per process.
- Following lines: Maximum demand matrix, one row per process.
- Last line: Number of available instances of each resource.

## Documentation
For detailed information about the implementation and usage of the program, refer to the `documentation.txt` file included in this project.
