Banker's Algorithm Project Documentation
Introduction:

This project implements the Banker's Algorithm in C++. The program is designed to determine if a set of processes and resources is in a safe state, avoiding deadlocks, and to find a safe sequence for process execution.


1. Compile the program using the command:
   g++ -o bankers_algorithm bankers_algorithm.cpp

2. Run the program with:
   ./bankers_algorithm

Input File Format:

The input.txt file should be formatted as follows:
- First line: Number of processes.
- Second line: Number of resources.
- Next lines: Allocation matrix, one row per process.
- Following lines: Maximum demand matrix, one row per process.
- Last line: Number of available instances of each resource.

Algorithm Explanation:

The Banker's Algorithm is used for deadlock avoidance. It tests if the system can allocate all resources to each process without running into a deadlock. The algorithm simulates resource allocation and checks for a safe sequence where all processes can complete without any of them getting stuck.

Output Interpretation:

The program's output will indicate whether the system is in a safe state. If it is, the program will also display a 'safe sequence'. This sequence is the order in which processes can run without causing a deadlock. If no safe sequence is found, it means the system is not in a safe state.
